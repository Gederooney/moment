### Task 5.0 - Video Previews (0%)
**Status:** ❌ NOT STARTED
- ⚠️ Requires FFmpeg native modules (react-native-ffmpeg)

- ✅ Settings screen exists and functional
- ✅ Storage management implemented
- ✅ Clear cache, clear all data

## 📊 Test Coverage Summary

### Passing Tests (56/69 = 81%)
- ✅ migrationService.test.ts (100%)
- ✅ momentStorage.test.ts (100%)
- ✅ folderStorage.test.ts (100%)
- ✅ tagService.test.ts (100%)
- ✅ tagFiltering.test.ts (100%)

### Failing Tests (13/69 = 19%)
