## 💡 Technical Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Discriminated Unions**: Moment type (YouTubeMoment | ScreenRecordingMoment)
- **Schema Versioning**: Migration system for data updates
- **Context Pattern**: State management across app
- **Circular Buffer**: Memory-efficient screen recording

### Tech Stack
- React Native (Expo 54)
- TypeScript
- AsyncStorage (persistence)
- @10play/tentap-editor (rich text)
- Jest (testing)

### Performance Targets
- Moment editor opens in <300ms
- Auto-save debounced at 3s
- Screen recording memory limit: 200MB
- Test coverage: ≥80%
